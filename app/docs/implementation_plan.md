  - [x] Run MCP Dev Inspector
  - [x] Run All Tests

## Phase 5: UTC Timestamps & HTTP Image Retrieval (COMPLETED ✅)

### Core Implementation
- [x] UTC Time Tool (`app/tools/utcnow.py`)
  - [x] `get_current_time()` returns UTC timestamp
  - [x] Allows Claude to query current date/time for temporal reasoning
  - [x] 3 comprehensive tests

  - [x] Fixed `camera.py` timestamp inconsistency (single timestamp for filename, log, and response)
  - [x] Updated `utils/jsonl_history.py` for timezone-aware comparisons
  - [x] Camera tool returns HTTP URLs instead of file paths
- [x] Environment Configuration

- **Timestamp consistency**: Generating timestamp once per operation prevents subtle mismatches
- **Static file serving**: FastAPI's built-in static files feature is perfect for serving photos (no nginx needed)
- **Test fixture updates**: When changing time handling, test fixtures need corresponding updates
- **KISS for hobby projects**: HTTP photo URLs work fine; no need for CDN or complex image serving

  - [x] `GET /status` - System health check
  - [x] CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- [x] Display UI (M5Unified, 2.0" LCD)
  - [x] WiFi status and IP address
  - [x] Live moisture reading with visual bar (updates every 2s)
  - [x] Pump status with countdown timer

- [x] Updated `app/tools/water_pump.py`
  - [x] Added ML-to-seconds conversion logic
  - [x] Calls `POST http://{ESP32_HOST}/pump {"seconds": N}`
  - [x] Calibration constant `PUMP_ML_PER_SECOND` from environment
  - [x] Validates against ESP32 safety limits (30s max)
  - [x] Records actual ML dispensed and seconds in history
  - [x] All existing safety limits retained (500ml/24h, gatekeeper)
- [x] Updated `app/.env.example`
  - [x] Added ESP32_HOST configuration
  - [x] Added ESP32_PORT configuration
  - [x] Added PUMP_ML_PER_SECOND calibration value
  - [x] Documented calibration procedure

### Documentation
- [x] Created `esp32/README.md`
  - [x] Hardware wiring diagrams and pin connections
  - [x] Arduino IDE setup and library installation
  - [x] Flashing instructions for macOS
  - [x] WiFi configuration guide
  - [x] HTTP API reference
  - [x] Display information
  - [x] Calibration procedures (moisture sensor + pump)
  - [x] Troubleshooting guide
- [x] Created `esp32/implementation_plan.md`
  - [x] 6 implementation phases (hardware, HTTP, WiFi, display, OTA, polish)
  - [x] Architecture and design principles (KISS, YAGNI)
  - [x] Code structure and key functions
  - [x] Testing strategy and calibration
  - [x] Safety considerations

### Lessons Learned
- **GPIO Selection**: CoreS3-SE has limited GPIO access - Port.A is I2C (avoid), M5-Bus pins require soldering
- **ML-to-Seconds Conversion**: Keeping conversion logic in FastAPI (not ESP32) allows calibration updates without reflashing
- **Safety Layers**: Dual safety limits (30s in ESP32, 500ml/24h in FastAPI) prevent failures from cascading
- **Arduino vs ESP-IDF**: Arduino IDE + M5Unified provides simpler development for hobby projects
- **Async HTTP Server**: ESPAsyncWebServer allows display updates during pump operation (non-blocking)
- **Error Messages**: Clear HTTP error responses from ESP32 help debug connection issues
- **KISS Success**: Simple HTTP REST API (no MQTT, no auth) works perfectly for private network hobby project

## Key Design Decisions
- No database initially - in-memory dictionaries
- Mock hardware - realistic fake data
- Single server with multiple tools
- No authentication initially
- Simple flat file structure
- Pydantic models for type safety

## Lessons Learned

### Phase 1
- FastMCP supports Pydantic models as tool parameters
- Test isolation is crucial - use pytest fixtures
- Separate unit tests from integration tests for clarity
- Mock data helps test without hardware dependencies
- Type consistency improves code reliability
- Code review feedback is valuable for improvement

### Phase 2
- JSONL append-only logs work well for time-series data
- Home Assistant HTTP API is reliable for IoT control
- Background asyncio tasks need proper lifecycle management
- Resource cleanup (HTTP clients, cameras) prevents leaks
- Environment variables provide good configuration flexibility
- OpenCV works consistently across Mac and Raspberry Pi
- Startup reconciliation prevents state drift

### Phase 3
- In-memory deques with JSONL persistence scale well (1000 entries in memory)
- Pagination support (offset parameter) enables efficient browsing of large histories
- Simple substring search is sufficient for a hobby project
- Pydantic Literal types provide clean enum validation
- Consistent patterns across tools make testing straightforward
- freezegun library is invaluable for time-based testing
- **DRY refactoring**: Following "Rule of Three" - consolidating after 3+ duplications pays off
- Centralized utilities (JsonlHistory) eliminate bugs across all modules simultaneously
- Missing ensure_loaded() calls are easy to miss - having one implementation prevents this

### Phase 4
- FastMCP's built-in HTTP server eliminates need for external web servers (Nginx, Apache)
- Streamable HTTP is the recommended transport (better than legacy SSE)
- Environment variables (MCP_HOST, MCP_PORT) provide deployment flexibility
- Systemd services provide robust process management for production
- VS Code launch.json configurations dramatically improve developer experience
- KISS principle: ~100 lines of code/config for full production deployment
- No need for Docker, health checks, or metrics for a hobby project (YAGNI)
- Comprehensive README documentation is crucial for hobby projects that might sit idle

- ⚠️ **No authentication**: MCP server and ESP32 have no auth (suitable for private network only)
- ⚠️ **Manual calibration required**: Pump rate must be calibrated by measuring water dispensed
- ⚠️ **Hardware wiring**: M5-Bus GPIO pins require soldering for sensor connections
- ⚠️ **Light dependency**: Requires Home Assistant running and accessible
- ⚠️ **Camera dependency**: Requires OpenCV and USB webcam hardware
- ⚠️ **Single ESP32 instance**: No support for multiple controllers or failover
