# Plant Care MCP Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- **Phase 1: COMPLETED ✅** - Core MCP setup with basic tools
- All code review feedback addressed
- 21 tests passing
- Ready for Phase 2

## Phase 1: Core MCP Setup & Basic Tools (COMPLETED ✅)
- [x] Install FastMCP and dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [x] Create basic FastMCP server structure in app/server.py
- [x] Create tools directory structure
- [x] Implement plant_status tool (gatekeeper)
- [x] Implement moisture_sensor tool with mock data
- [x] Create test suite (21 tests: 6 unit for plant_status, 8 unit for moisture_sensor, 7 integration)
- [x] Address all code review feedback
- [x] Fix type consistency using Pydantic models

## Phase 2: Action Tools (COMPLETED ✅)
- [x] Implement action tools
   - [x] `app/tools/water_pump.py` - Track daily usage in memory
   - [x] `app/tools/light.py` - Track on/off state and timing
   - [x] `app/tools/camera.py` - Return placeholder URL
- [x] Add simple validation
   - [x] Enforce 500ml/24hr water limit
   - [x] Enforce light timing constraints
   - [x] Use Pydantic models
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite (25 new tests)
- [x] Integration tests for all tools working together
- [x] Time-based testing with freezegun

## Phase 3: Thinking & Logging (Third PR)
1. **Implement state management tools**
   - `app/tools/thinking.py` - Store thoughts/plans
   - `app/tools/action_log.py` - Track actions
   - In-memory storage with list/dict structures

2. **Add query capabilities**
   - Implement `get_recent()`, `search()` methods
   - Simple substring matching

## Phase 4: HTTP Deployment (Fourth PR)
1. **Add HTTP server capability**
   - Use FastMCP's built-in HTTP server
   - Create `app/run_http.py` for deployment
   - Basic CORS configuration

2. **Create deployment configuration**
   - `fastmcp.json` for server configuration
   - systemd service file for Raspberry Pi

## Key Design Decisions
- No database initially - in-memory dictionaries
- Mock hardware - realistic fake data
- Single server with multiple tools
- No authentication initially
- Simple flat file structure
- Pydantic models for type safety

## Lessons Learned from Phase 1
- FastMCP supports Pydantic models as tool parameters
- Test isolation is crucial - use pytest fixtures
- Separate unit tests from integration tests for clarity
- Mock data helps test without hardware dependencies
- Type consistency improves code reliability
- Code review feedback is valuable for improvement

## How to Run

### Development Server
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run MCP inspector (opens browser)
uv run fastmcp dev server.py

# Run server with stdio transport
uv run fastmcp run server:mcp --transport stdio
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest test_*.py -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest test_plant_status.py -v

# Run manual debugging test
uv run python simple_test.py
```

## Ready for Phase 2
- Foundation established with gatekeeper pattern
- Test infrastructure in place (21 tests)
- Type system properly configured
- Mock sensor provides realistic test data
- Clear separation of concerns in code structure
